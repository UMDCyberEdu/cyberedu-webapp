# Securing your data with 2FA

“2FA” stands for “2 Factor Authentication”. It refers to 2 layers of security. Most people just have 1 layer of security: their password.

The availability and options for 2FA vary from site to site. Many popular websites, such as Facebook and Google, offer an option to enable 2FA. In addition to your password, you can get secret SMS codes, make a USB drive your “key”, or more to act as a second layer of security.
