Every year, hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions, of passwords are leaked online.

28% of US Adults use the same password for most of their online accounts (Source: BusinessInsider). If even one account's password is leaked, then several accounts become compromised.

ALL of your data on the Internet is protected by passwords. Your messages, emails, photos, and accounts are protected by passwords.

In this module, you'll learn how to create strong passwords so you can keep your data secure and how you can mitigate the fallout from being hacked.
