# Creating Strong Passwords

Complexity and length. The complexity and length of a password determine the strength of the password.

The more characters there are in a password, the longer it takes to brute force through all possible passwords of that length. It's a lot harder to guess a password that's 20 characters long than a password that's 4 characters long.

The complexity of a password matters because hackers are starting to use smarter techniques for guessing passwords. Hackers have found the following patterns in many people's passwords:

* Use of dictionary words in their native language (e.g. English)
* Numbers tend to be present at the beginning or end of a password
* Symbols like '3', '@', '4', '0' are often used in replace of similar characters like 'E', 'a', 'A', 'o'.

Hackers will prioritize guessing passwords that follow patterns like the above. So passwords like "blu3b3rrymuffins70" are weak passwords despite being lengthy. **A strong password is long AND complex**.

Try making a complex and long password and checking it out in the input below:

_Show the jquery plugin to check user's password_

Here's an example of a strong password: \`XJ?NdjneTw4947woS*W-+[DJx%$#\`

But wait, that looks ridiculous. How do we remember that?

In the next section, we'll learn about password management.
