### Phishing Over the Phone

Phishers will often ask for usernames, passwords, banking information, or even Social Security Numbers over the phone. NEVER give usernames, passwords, banking information, or Social Security Numbers over the phone. It’s standard procedure for companies, banks, and governmental entities to obtain this information either through mail or email.

### Phishing Websites

These are websites that pretend to be the websites of other companies and use their false appearance to get the credentials of a user. Whenever you type in your credentials on a website, always pay attention to the URL link. The following is a fake Facebook website:

It looks the real Facebook but let’s zoom in on that URL.

And there we can tell that the website is not the real Facebook.
